# IoT-Based-Gas-Level-Detection-System
Built a real-time gas monitor using MQ sensors, Arduino &amp; Python. Set threshold alerts for hazardous levels, triggering instant notifications. Logged data for analysis &amp; visualized trends via Matplotlib. Calibrated sensors to ±3% accuracy—boosting safety &amp; enabling early hazard detection.
